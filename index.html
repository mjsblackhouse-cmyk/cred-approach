Leaders develop capabilities whilst making real decisions on real challenges, not through workshops or coaching sessions removed from operational context.</p> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>What I Do</h2> <p>Through Black House, I provide strategic support to boards and leadership teams facing complex challenges. This typically includes:</p> <ul> <li>Board effectiveness reviews and development programmes</li> <li>Executive team performance and culture work</li> <li>Strategic guidance during periods of significant change or complexity</li> <li>Independent chair or director roles during critical periods</li> </ul> <p>My approach involves sustained engagement rather than project-based consulting. Most client relationships span several years, allowing for development through multiple decision cycles.</p> </div> <div class="current-roles"> <h2>Current Roles</h2> <ul> <li>Chair, Starbucks Australia (since 2015)</li> <li>Director, AusCycling (since 2020, Chair of High Performance Committee)</li> <li>Chair, Football Innovations Committee, West Coast Eagles (since 2025)</li> <li>Mentor in Residence, Hawaiian (since 2024)</li> <li>Chair of Judges, EY Entrepreneur of the Year</li> <li>Principal, Black House (since 2009)</li> </ul> </div> <div class="section"> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Over the past four decades, I have served as chair or director across corporate, government, not-for-profit, arts and sporting organisations.

Directors decide collectively and need to function as high-performing teams, adapting processes and judgement to the matters before them.</p> <p>My work focuses on helping boards and leadership teams reach their potential as guardians and leaders of their organisations. This is less about scoring past performance and more about identifying the next stage of evolution and collaborating on plans that can be successfully implemented.</p> <p>The work is evidence-based, using relevant benchmarks and established instruments to compare purpose, principles, practices and performance against comparable organisations.</p> </div> <div class="footer"> <p><strong>Black House</strong><br> 610/20 Gugeri Street, Claremont, Western Australia<br> Principal: Michael Smith AO FAICD</p> </div> </body> </html>
