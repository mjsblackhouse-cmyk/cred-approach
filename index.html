                <p>My interest lies in helping the leaders, and their teams, of purposeful organisations deal with their most consequential, complex, culture-shaping decisions.</p>
                
                <p>I work with boards and executive teams by being present at the table during critical decisions. Leaders develop capabilities whilst making real decisions on real challenges, not through workshops or coaching sessions removed from operational context.</p>

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>Through Black House, I provide strategic support to boards and leadership teams facing complex challenges. This typically includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Board effectiveness reviews and development programmes</li>
                    <li>Executive team performance and culture work</li>
                    <li>Strategic guidance during periods of significant change or complexity</li>
                    <li>Independent chair or director roles during critical periods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My approach involves sustained engagement rather than project-based consulting. Most client relationships span several years, allowing for development through multiple decision cycles.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>

                <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
                <p>I typically work with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boards and chairs facing complex governance challenges</li>
                    <li>CEOs and executive teams navigating significant transitions</li>
                    <li>Organisations requiring independent expertise during critical periods</li>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>Board work is a team activity. Directors decide collectively and need to function as high-performing teams, adapting processes and judgement to the matters before them.</p>
                <p>My work focuses on helping boards and leadership teams reach their potential as guardians and leaders of their organisations. This is less about scoring past performance and more about identifying the next stage of evolution and collaborating on plans that can be successfully implemented.</p>
                <p>The work is evidence-based, using relevant benchmarks and established instruments to compare purpose, principles, practices and performance against comparable organisations.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Published Work</h2>
                <p>I contributed to <em>Age of Doubt: Navigating Mistrust in Modern Society</em>, a collection examining how trust is disappearing and how we might navigate these times. The book brings together global experts in media, science, government, academia and business to explore the foundations of institutional trust and paths forward.</p>
                <p>As reviewer Michelle Grattan observed: "Trust is the golden thread that binds our democracy, yet it is fraying. This book is a rich and diverse trove of information and opinions on dealing with a central issue of our time."</p>
